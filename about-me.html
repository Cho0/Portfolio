          <p class="about-me-description">Technology has always been at the forefront of my life. I loved computer building and learning about them ever since I was a little boy. And from a young age, I always wanted to do something in the tech field. However, I was surrounded by art and had been an artist for quite a while now due to my familyâ€™s obsession with it. And because of my background in art, I am an excellent communicator with other artists. I have also developed my skills as a full-stack web developer and I am excited to continue to develop and deepen my understanding of code.</p>
