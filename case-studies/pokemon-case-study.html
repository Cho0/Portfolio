          <h1>Overview:</h1>
          <p>I created this app using JavaScript, jQuery, and BootStrap, which will display Pokemon in a list. When the desired Pokemon is selected, it will open a model to show the Pokemon’s data</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case">
          <h1>Purpose and Context:</h1>
          <p>The Pokedex app is CareerFoundry's boot camp course project that displays mastery of basic JavaScript and an understanding of jQuery and BootStrap. Selecting specific elements and manipulating the DOM was also essential for making this project work, as PokeAPI was used to display the Pokemon data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case">
          <h1>Objective:</h1>
          <p>My aim for this project was to be a learning source to understand the basics of Javascript and put everything together to create an application.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case">
          <h1>Approach:</h1>
          <p>A forLoop is used to create a new element for each entry in the API. Every new element created becomes a primary button that, when pressed, opens a smaller window called a modal. The app will display the Pokemon’s name, typing, height, image, and multiple ways to exit the modal in this window. When creating the client-side of this project, I chose to stay true to the games. In the games, the Pokedex shows as a list; hence the app uses a list style. After placing the list and logo, a simplistic Pokeball was added as a background to compliment the button’s style.</p>
          <p class="approach-p-2">Using BootStrap, jQuery, and some CSS, styling the applications was easy and clean. BootStrap created a functional button and modal that I didn’t have to change much, and jQuery quickly appended HTML elements to the Javascript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case2">
          <h1>Challenges:</h1>
          <p>As with learning any coding language, nothing ever works on the first try. Much research went to understanding how to reference the API data in my Javascript. There was a lot of trial and error in the debugger and asking for help from a mentor. These setbacks were essential to my learning process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case2">
          <h1>Future:</h1>
          <p>As a developer, I am constantly learning new and more innovative things. For example, if I were to go back to this project, I’d like to start over with React.js for practice or Angular.js to learn. I’d also completely redesign the UI and Modal with some nice little animations.</p>
